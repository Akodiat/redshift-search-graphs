## Try it now
Simply go to https://akodiat.github.io/redshift-search-graphs to try the app yourself.

## Running locally
To run it locally, you need to start a static HTTP server in this directory. You can easily do that with the following Python command ([or any of these other options](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255))

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then, you can go to [localhost:8000](HTTP:/localhost:8000) (or whatever port you used above) to view the app.
